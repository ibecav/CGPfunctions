### Overview

A package that includes functions that I find useful for teaching statistics as
well as actually practicing the art. They typically are not "new" methods but
rather wrappers around either base R or `tidyverse` packages. Currently contains
the following major user oriented functions:

- `Plot2WayANOVA` which as the name implies conducts a 2 way ANOVA and plots 
  the results using `ggplot2`
- `PlotXTabs2` which wraps around `ggplot2` to provide Bivariate bar charts 
  for categorical and ordinal data.
- `newggslopegraph` which creates a Tufte"esque" slopegraph using `ggplot2`
- `chaid_table` provides tabular summary of `CHAID` `partykit` object
- `cross2_var_vectors` a helper function to build lists of "crossed" variables
- `SeeDist` which wraps around `ggplot2` to provide visualizations of univariate data.
- `OurConf` is a simulation function that helps you learn about confidence intervals

### Installation

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Install from CRAN
install.packages("CGPfunctions")

# Or the development version from GitHub
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ibecav/CGPfunctions", 
                         build_vignettes = TRUE,
                         upgrade = "ask")
```

### Usage

[Online documentation and vignettes are located here](https://ibecav.github.io/CGPfunctions/).

#### Example [Plot2WayANOVA](https://ibecav.github.io/CGPfunctions/articles/Using-Plot2WayANOVA.html) plot

```{r example1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Example Plot2WayANOVA", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://ibecav.github.io/CGPfunctions/articles/Using-Plot2WayANOVA_files/figure-html/Plot2WayANOVA3-1.png")
```

#### Example [PlotXTabs2](https://ibecav.github.io/CGPfunctions/articles/Using-PlotXTabs2.html) plot

```{r example2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Example PlotXTabs2 plot", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://ibecav.github.io/CGPfunctions/articles/Using-PlotXTabs2_files/figure-html/vignette2-2.png")
```

#### Example [newggslopegraph](https://ibecav.github.io/CGPfunctions/articles/Using-newggslopegraph.html) plot

```{r example3, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Example newggslopegraph plot", out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://ibecav.github.io/CGPfunctions/articles/Using-newggslopegraph_files/figure-html/ggslope7-1.png")
