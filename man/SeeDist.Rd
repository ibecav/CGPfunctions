\arguments{
\item{x}{the data to be visualized. Must be numeric.}

\item{title}{Optionally replace the default title displayed. title = NULL 
will remove it entirely. title = "" will provide an empty title but 
retain the spacing. A sensible default is provided otherwise.}

\item{subtitle}{Optionally replace the default subtitle displayed. subtitle = NULL 
will remove it entirely. subtitle = "" will provide an empty subtitle but 
retain the spacing. A sensible default is provided otherwise.}

\item{numbins}{the number of bins to use for any plots that bin. If nothing is
specified the function will calculate a rational number using Freedman-Diaconis
via the \code{nclass.FD} function}

\item{xlab}{Custom text for the `x` axis label (Default: `NULL`, which
will cause the `x` axis label to be the `x` variable).}

\item{var_explain}{additional contextual information about the variable as a string
such as "Miles Per Gallon" which is appended to the default title information.}

\item{data.fill.color}{Character string that specifies fill color for the main data
area (Default: `deepskyblue`).}

\item{mean.line.color, median.line.color, mode.line.color}{Character string that 
specifies line color (Default: `darkgreen`, `yellow`, `orange`).}

\item{mean.line.type, median.line.type, mode.line.type}{Character string that 
specifies line color (Default: `longdash`, `dashed`, `dashed`).}

\item{mean.line.size, median.line.size, mode.line.size}{Numeric that 
specifies line size (Default: `1.5`, `1.5`, `1`).  You can set to `0` to make
any of the lines "disappear".}

\item{mean.point.shape, median.point.shape}{Integer in 0 - 25 
specifies shape of mean or median point mark on the violin plot
(Default: `21`, `23`).}

\item{mean.point.size, median.point.size}{Integer
specifies size of mean or median point mark on the violin plot
(Default: `4`). You can set to `0` to make any of the points "disappear".}

\item{zcurve.color, tcurve.color}{Character string that 
specifies line color (Default: `red`, `black`).}

\item{zcurve.type, tcurve.type}{Character string that 
specifies line color (Default: `twodash`, `dotted`).}

\item{zcurve.size, tcurve.size}{Numeric that 
specifies line size (Default: `1`).  You can set to `0` to make
any of the lines "disappear".}

\item{whatplots}{what type of plots?  The default is whatplots = c("d", "b", 
"h", "v") for a density, a boxplot, a histogram, and a violin plot}

\item{k}{Number of digits after decimal point (should be an integer)
(Default: k = 2) for statistical results.}

\item{add_jitter}{Logical (Default: `TRUE`) controls whether jittered data
ponts are added to violin plot.}

\item{add_rug}{Logical (Default: `TRUE`) controls whether "rug" data
points are added to density plot and histogram.}

\item{xlim_left, xlim_right}{Logical. For density plots can be used to 
override the default which is 3 std deviations left and right of
the mean of x. Useful for theoretical reasons like horsepower < 0
or when `ggplot2` warns you that it has removed rows containing
non-finite values (stat_density).}

\item{ggtheme}{A function, ggplot2 theme name. Default value is ggplot2::theme_bw().
Any of the ggplot2 themes, or themes from extension packages are allowed (e.g.,
hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum(), etc.).}
}
\value{
from 1 to 4 plots depending on what the user specifies as well as an
  extensive summary courtesy `DescTools::Desc` printed to the console
}
\description{
This function takes a vector of numeric data and returns one or more ggplot2
plots that help you visualize the data.  Meant to be a useful wrapper for
exploring univariate data.  Has a plethora of options including type of
visualization (histogram, boxplot, density, violin) as well as commonly
desired overplots like mean and median points, z and t curves etc..  Common
descriptive statistics are provided as a subtitle if desired and sent to the
console as well.
}
\section{Warning}{

  If the data has more than 3 modal values only the first three of them are plotted.
  The rest are ignored and the user is warned on the console.

Missing values are removed with a warning to the user
